## Job Functions

As a frontend developer, you will develop, document, and test UI components 🖌 for different web apps on our platform. This means you should have experience creating UI components (dashboards or individual components), whether self-taught or by contributing to an open-source project 😍.

You will learn to build new web components (Web Components), document them, and test them with automated tests 🤖. You will also help with day-to-day bug fixes 🐞 in our existing UIs. Additionally, you will learn to maintain highly complex Web APIs like WebRTC.

You will work closely with a specialized team and our CTO, who is, of course, extremely friendly, cool 🤪, and will teach you everything.

We will track progress based on tasks assigned in Github projects, allowing us to see the overall team progress 🤟. We have weekly _company-wide meetings to discuss team progress, needs, ideas, visions, suggestions, etc. 🤓

You will start with a 3-month trial period. 🤝 After that, depending on your performance and synergy with the team, you will become a permanent team member. 🥳

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> We hope you will learn from our team the first 3 months. After that you will have more independency working on your tasks.

## Our Work Style

We work based on tasks, so we don't expect you to sit in front of the screen for 5 hours straight doing nothing and end up with lordosis 😉. If you like working in the early morning, in the morning, afternoon, or night, that's great 🤷‍♀️, as long as you complete your tasks. 👌

## What is Videsk?

Videsk is the first plug-and-play video contact center on the market. What does that mean? We provide video conferencing communication between businesses and consumers on websites, mobile apps, interactive kiosks, SDKs, Rest APIs, etc.

In other words, our clients integrate our solution into everything with internet access (yes, everything) using scripts/SDKs. We are a SaaS _company that heavily relies on technology.

We create and love open-source code; you can see our Github at https://github.com/videsk and Figma at https://www.figma.com/@videsk.

We use technology such as WebRTC, Node, Javascript, Java, Swift, Kotlin, Web APIs, WebSocket, Bash, WebAssembly, Vue, Svelte, etc. Much of it is young technology or its application is new/recent, which adds a significant challenge.
